# Problem 1:

## Read and clean data sets

``` r
library(readxl)

trash_wheel = read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", 1, range = "A2:N338") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, digits=0)) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))

precip_2017 = read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", 4, range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(total) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017)

precip_2018 = read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", 3, range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(total) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018)

precip_combined_2017_2018 = 
  bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

Two data sets have been successfully imported and cleaned: (1)
trash\_wheel and (2) precip\_both\_years.

**trash\_wheel**: This data set has 285 observations and 14 columns
describing the weight and volume of trash pulled out of the Inner Harbor
in Baltimore by month from 2014 to 2018. Additional variables describe
the type of trash pulled (e.g. plastic bottles, cigarette butts, and
sports balls). For example, in 2014 Mr. Trash Wheel pulled out 141.35
tons and 669 cubic yards of trash. Additionally, in 2017 the median
number of sports balss in a dumpster pulled from Mr. Trash Wheel was 2.

**precip\_both\_years**: This data set has 19 observations and 3 columns
describing the total precipation in inches by month from 2017 to 2018.
For example, from the table we know that the precipitation in January
2018 was 0.96 inches and total precipation in 2018 was 23.5 inches.

## REMEMBER YOU DIDN’T DO THE MEDIAN

# Problem 2:

``` r
